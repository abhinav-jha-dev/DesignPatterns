# Creational Pattern
In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

## Abstract Factory Pattern
Creates an instance of several families of classes

### Concept

### Problem
If an application is to be portable, it needs to encapsulate platform dependencies. These "platforms" might include: windowing system, operating system, database, etc. Too often, this encapsulation is not engineered in advance, and lots of #ifdef case statements with options for all currently supported platforms begin to procreate like rabbits throughout the code.
