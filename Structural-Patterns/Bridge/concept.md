# Bridge Pattern

> Bridge pattern state to separate abstraction from implementation.

So what does this mean, in previous pattern we have learned how to use Adapter pattern to convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. You can use Adapter Pattern when you are working with existing application but what if you are working with new application. There we have Bridge Pattern, which helps to separate Abstraction (the GUI layer of the app) from the Implementation (the operating system APIs).
